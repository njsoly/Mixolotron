MIXOLOTRON
---------------------------------------------------------

Mixolotron is my one-word nickname for my first capstone project at UW-Stout (collaborated with two others).  It consisted of a custom-built pump machine, controlled by a PLC, which interfaced with several components connected to an Arduino Mega 2560 R3.  My part of the project was the Arduino side.
 
**Features:**
- 21-year-old DOB check, complete with externally-powered RTC module
- Automatic amounts for liquid pumps...
- Color display for messaging and choices

**Application Ideas:**

- As a repository for Arduino and other code as it relates to the "Mixolotron".
